# Gabriel Wilkes's Resume

In LaTeX format so I can comfortably work on my resume in a code editor instead of fiddling with MS Word. I really like the resume design Gayle L. McDowell uses at http://www.careercup.com/resume. Daniil Belyakov made a LaTeX version of that design that I used as the starting template for my resume: https://github.com/dnl-blkv/mcdowell-cv

Another thing I like about the LaTeX format is that very easy to make different resume versions as needed by commenting or uncommenting parts of the resume text.
